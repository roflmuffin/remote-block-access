# Remote Block Access

A simple Fabric mod that adds an item (with 4 tiers) that let you remotely access the interfaces of machines within a certain amount of blocks.

## Getting Started

Simply craft the below recipe into a remote accessor item, and then shift right-click on the block you would like to link to the item. You can link up to 5 (by default; this is configurable) blocks to the one inventory accessor. If you then right click with the item in the hand you will either open the blocks interface, or open a searchable interface if there are multiple blocks linked to the same item.

The item will mimic the same face & hit position when you save using the "shift right-click" so this will work on things like vanilla Minecraft buttons & levers etc.

The item comes in four tiers, simply replace the items in the crafting recipe: Iron, Gold, Diamond, Emeralds.
